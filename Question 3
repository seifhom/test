The Pros for question 2-1 :
the  code is simple and requires less memory and time for execution. 
the correction consider 4 surrounding pixel to make it compatible.
The Cons for Question 2-1 :
comparing to question 2-2 the correction of brightness is not better and not enough because it considers just 4 so we have less adaption.
 
The Pros for question 2-2 :
consider 9 pixel including the tested pixel itself will enhance the accuracy.
The Cons for question 2-2 : 
more time of execution,more memory allocation for variable, more complexity in the code.
if the brightness changes a lot it will affect the test.
